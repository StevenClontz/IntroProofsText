  <title>Proof by Induction</title>
  <introduction>
   
    <p>
     In this chapter we introduce a new proof technique called mathematical induction. Induction is a technique that can be used to prove statements about the positive integers. In particular, it is a useful technique when there is a connection between the statement for <m>n</m> and for <m>n+1</m>.
