<div class="para">Existence statements are common in mathematics. You probably came across several in calculus, for example, Rolle's Theorem and the Mean Value Theorem. Although their proofs are beyond the scope of this course, you are encouraged to look up a proof and see how the techniques we've been studying are applied. In many contexts, it can be very difficult to find a candidate. If you are stuck, it might be worth trying proof by contradiction. In this case, you assume there does not exist <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> satisfying <span class="process-math">\(P(x)\text{.}\)</span> Symbolically this statement is <span class="process-math">\(\neg \exists x, P(x)\text{.}\)</span> The negation is equivalent to <span class="process-math">\(\forall x, \neg P(x)\text{.}\)</span> You can then use <span class="process-math">\(\forall x, \neg P(x)\)</span> for your assumption and try to reach a contradiction.</div>
