<div class="para">We would like to know if Goldbach's Conjecture is true. We can start by just trying several examples. We want to see if positive even integers greater than 2 (like 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. For example, <span class="process-math">\(6=3+3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(12=5+7\text{.}\)</span> Now try to write 4, 8, and 10 as the sum of two primes. Note,  1 is NOT prime. We will see this later when we formally define primes.</div>
