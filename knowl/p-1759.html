<div class="para">So what about the set of rational numbers, <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{Q}\text{?}\)</span> To show it is countable, we need to find a one-to-one correspondence with <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{N}\text{.}\)</span> As we saw in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/E_Zcountable.html" title="Example 6.2.5: The Integers are Countable">Example 6.2.5</a> is that it is enough to find a way to list the rational numbers. However, one of the properties of the rational numbers that makes this challenging is that between any two rational numbers, <span class="process-math">\(a, b\text{,}\)</span> there is another rational number. We proved this in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/E_generalexistence.html" title="Example 5.1.2: A More General Existence Proof">Example 5.1.2</a> by showing the average, <span class="process-math">\(\frac{a+b}{2}\)</span> is between <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> But since the average is also rational, there is another rational number between <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{a+b}{2}\text{,}\)</span> and so on. Thus, in fact, between any two rational numbers there are infinitely many rational numbers. So it would seem the rationals might be “larger” than <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{N}\text{.}\)</span>
