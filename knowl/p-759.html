<div class="para">The basic idea behind proof by contradiction is that if you assume the statement you want to prove is false, and this forces a logical contradiction, then you must have been wrong to start. Thus, you can conclude the original statement was true. By a logical contradiction, we generally mean a statement that must be both true and false at the same time. When writing a proof by contradiction you must be very careful in your logical reasoning. It must be clear that you reach a contradiction though careful logical deduction.</div>
