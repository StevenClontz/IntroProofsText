<div class="para">First, start with finite sets. The size of a finite set is the number of elements in the set. It may seem simple to determine the size of a set by just counting the elements. But suppose I have a bag of candy and a class of students. I could decide if I have enough candy by just counting the pieces and the students and seeing if I have more candy or students. But suppose I have a lot of candy and a lot of students. It might be faster just to start passing out the candy to the students. If I run out of candy, I have more students; if I run out of students, I have more candy. We will use this idea of matching up objects in two sets to define the size of a set and to decide which set is bigger.</div>
