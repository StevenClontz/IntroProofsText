<div class="para">Is <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/E_intandevencard.html" title="Example 6.2.3: Cardinality of the Even Integers">Example 6.2.3</a> surprising? On one hand, it may seem surprising since the even integers is a proper subset of the integers, so it may seem like there are “more” integers then even integers (maybe even twice as many!). On the other hand, both sets have infinitely many elements, so since they both have infinite “size,” it may seem reasonable that the two sets have the same size. The idea behind the definition of cardinality is that the map gives us a way to match up elements in the two sets. Since they can be matched up exactly, the two sets must have the same size, or cardinality.</div>
